    <p>HubSpot's Contact Us page demonstrates how a contact page can be used as a customer service tool. At the top, there are two prominent CTAs connecting visitors with the HubSpot Sales and Support teams. HubSpot understands people visiting this page are likely interested in purchasing a product or need help troubleshooting one. By placing those buttons at the top of the page, HubSpot provides proactive customer service to its visitors.</p><br>
    <p>The Weifield Group's Contact Us page is an excellent example of one that is mobile-friendly and responsive. Check out the desktop version of its contact page first, followed by its contact page on mobile â€” and note how it has optimized every part of the page for mobile. The text is large, the form fields are easy to fill out, and their CTA button is large and easily clickable, making for a much more seamless mobile experience.</p>
