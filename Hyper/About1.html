    <center><h1>This is About page</h1></center>
    <p>As a heart-centered brand that cares about its global impact, Iya Foods emphasizes that key part of its brand in its mission statement. Describing your brand values and what you stand for is one of the best ways to connect with your audience. This approach doesn’t have to be boring. Add ingredients that showcase what makes your brand great. Iya Foods effectively uses images, its social media links, and even the notable publications it’s been featured in, giving it plenty of credibility. </p><br>
    <p>As your users scroll to the end, consider how valuable the “real estate” at the bottom of your About Us page is. Instead of creating a dead end by finishing your brand story or simply listing brand values, entice your audience to explore your products by linking to your bestsellers. Use Lunya’s approach for inspiration. </p>
